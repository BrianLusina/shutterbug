# Volt CI

This is a simplified minimal continuous integration (CI) system that demonstrates how typical CI systems work. The assumption here is that you have git installed on your PATH.

## Pre-requisites

A list of some of the things you will need to have on your development environment

### Python 3.5+

Have Python installed on your PATH & preferrably Python 3.5+

### Posix

This uses bash scripts for some of the tasks, so ensure you are running in an environment with POSIX

### Git

Have git installed & on your PATH as the _repo-observer_  will be watching on changes on a sample git repository and will use git commands to run the CI system
